# Buffalo LinkStation Sync Manager Requirements
# Core application uses only Python standard library modules

# The following modules are used (all part of Python standard library):
# - tkinter (GUI)
# - threading (background tasks)
# - pathlib (file path handling)
# - shutil (file operations)
# - hashlib (file verification)
# - json (config storage)
# - fnmatch (pattern matching)
# - os (system operations)
# - time (scheduling)
# - datetime (timestamps)
# - smtplib (email notifications)

# For Python 3.7+ on Windows, Linux, or macOS
# Note: tkinter comes with Python but may need to be installed separately on some Linux systems:
# Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install python3-tk
# Fedora: sudo dnf install python3-tkinter
# Arch: sudo pacman -S tk

# Optional dependencies for Windows system tray icon (recommended for Windows users):
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
pystray>=0.19.0
pillow>=10.0.0

# Note: The application will work without these packages,
# but the system tray icon feature will be disabled
